# LANStream

LANStream is a lightweight, database-free, web-based media browser and player for local networks.

It is designed for people who want to open a browser, peruse a media collection, and play videos without maintaining a proper database, importing a library, matching metadata, running background scans, or really putting any effort into it at all.

LANStream runs on Linux through Docker or as a portable Windows application. It supports direct playback whenever the browser can handle the source file and automatically falls back to hardware-accelerated or software transcoding when necessary.

## Why LANStream?

Most home media servers are built around a managed library. That is ideal if you want posters, metadata matching, watch history, recommendations, user profiles, and a streaming-service-style interface.

Not everybody needs all that.  If your media is already organized into folders and you simply want to poke around and play the files, a full media-management platform can be more effort than it's worth.

LANStream is

- **Database-free**  
  There is no media database to create, migrate, repair, or back up.
- **Scan-free**  
  LANStream does not need to index your entire collection before it becomes usable. Directories are read when you browse them.
- **Folder-native**  
  Your existing directory structure is the interface. There is no requirement to rename or reorganize files for metadata matching.
- **Read-only toward your media**  
  LANStream does not need to modify files in your media collection.
- **Portable**  
  The Windows build can be extracted and run as a self-contained application. The Linux version can run in Docker with configuration and cache files kept outside the container.
- **Low-maintenance**  
  There are no library refresh schedules, database upgrades, metadata agents, or background cataloging jobs to manage.
- **LAN-focused**  
  LANStream is optimized for simple local-network playback rather than trying to be an all-purpose cloud media ecosystem.

This makes it particularly useful for:

- large collections that are already organized by folder
- archive drives
- home-video collections
- temporary or portable media servers
- off-grid or popup media streaming
- shared household folders
- systems where simplicity and transparency matter more than rich metadata

## Features

- Browse ordinary folders directly from a web browser
- Multiple configurable media roots
- Client-side filtering of the currently displayed directory
- Lazy thumbnail generation
- Cached thumbnails and preview images
- Dedicated browser-based video player
- Extremely low seek latency and buffering times
- Audio & subtitle track selection
- Low-bandwidth mode for congested networks

### Transcoding

Videos will be streamed directly to the browser when possible.  For formats unsupported by the browser, LANStream automatically detects available encoders and selects an appropriate backend.

**Windows**

- Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV)
- NVIDIA NVENC
- AMD AMF
- software H.264

**Linux / Docker**

- VAAPI
- NVIDIA NVENC
- software H.264

The active backend and capability-test results can be viewed at:

<your LANStream address>/transcoder-status
```


### Access Control

LANStream can run completely passwordless on a trusted LAN, use a single master password, or define multiple password profiles.

Profiles can expose different roots and exclude specific subfolders.


## Installation

### Windows

The Windows release is distributed as a portable, self-contained folder.  Download the latest release zip.

1. Extract the release archive.
2. Edit `config.txt`.
3. Run `LANStream.exe`.
4. Open the displayed LAN URL in a browser.

See [manual.md](manual.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Linux / Docker

LANStream can be run in Docker.

The recommended deployment keeps user data outside the container:

```text
config.txt
cache/
```

Media directories are mounted read-only.

This means the container can be rebuilt or replaced without losing configuration or thumbnail cache data.

NVIDIA NVENC in Docker requires NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the host.

A Linux Easy Config preset is provided for deployments using LEC.

## Requirements

### Client

A reasonably modern web browser with HTML5 video support.

### Windows server

- 64-bit Windows 10/11
- Hardware acceleration is optional

### Linux server

- Docker
- `/dev/dri` access for VAAPI when applicable
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit when using NVENC in Docker
